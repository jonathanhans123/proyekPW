    <h1>Our online shop, isn't just a shop</h1>
    <h2>Our journey begin...</h2>
    <p>In 1999, for the first time, Shoes shop is established.<br>
        At that time, this shop is still a small local shop in a little town in California, USA.<br>
    From time, over time, this shop keeps growing until be a successful shop.<br>
    From generation to another generation, this shop keeps growing.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>The downfall of the Shoes shop</h2>
    <p>In late 2013, our Shoes shop got a big downfall. Our profit change to a loss. Our loss amounted to around 50% of our company's net worth. We just kept selling shoes, we kept trying without giving up, and suddenly, the bussiness rose up from its downfall</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>The establishing of the Shoes online shop</h2>
    <p>After some time, we thought to expand our bussiness based on our downfall on our past. At first, we confused how to expand it. But one day, an idea suddenly appeared in our mind. yes, it's the time to open our own online shop that sells shoes. And so, in 2014, we make it happen. The online shop keep going until now.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Our Motto</h2>
    <p>"Nothing last forever, we can change the future."</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>We want to give you a comfortable shopping experience without any hassle around you. So, you can just looking and picking our shoes that fit and (maybe) be the best for you, and maybe you could buy one or more for your family.</p>
